\title{Description of holzinger data with 1 outlier}
\description{
A sample of 100 simulated cases from the infamous Holzinger dataset
using 9 variables, but with 1 outlier added to the dataset. The first row was replaced
by adding 2 to five of the observed variables (odd-numbered items) and subtracting 2 from
the other four observed variables (even-numbered items).
